### Natural-Language-Processing

This repository contains codes for natural language processing from text classification to dialogue system. 
We were started by doing text classification with Naive Bayes and softmax classifiers within a large vocabular. After that, it is the step of language modeling on which we introduced the concept of n-gram language models where the probability of a word given a history ('prefix') only depends on the preceding  nâˆ’1  words. We also introduce classical neural network and recurrent neural network. To do machine translation, instead of using directly those recurrent neural network we use both lstm and gru to avoid vanishing gradient, one of biggest problem we can know on machine translation with simple recurrent neural network. Finally we called ParlAI framework and Fairseq to lead the question answering and dialogue systems.
