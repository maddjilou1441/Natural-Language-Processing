### Natural-Language-Processing

This repository contains codes for natural language processing from text classification to dialogue system. 
We were started by doing text classification with Naive Bayes and softmax classifiers within a large vocabular. After that, it is the step of language modeling on which we introduced the concept of n-gram language models where the probability of a word given a history ('prefix') only depends on the preceding  nâˆ’1  words. We also introduce classical neural network and recurrent neural network. To do machine translation, instead of using directly those recurrent neural network we use two specific types of recurrent neural network lstm and gru to avoid vanishing gradient, one of the biggest problem we know on machine translation with simple recurrent neural network. Also, in that task of machine translation we introduce one of the most influential idea in deep learning that is attention idea. Finally we called ParlAI framework and Fairseq to lead the question answering and dialogue systems.
