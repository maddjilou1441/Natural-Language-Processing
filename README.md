### Natural-Language-Processing

This repository contains codes for natural language processing from text classification to dialogue system. 
We start by doing text classification with Naive Bayes classifier and softmax classifier within a large vocabar. After that, it is the step of language modeling on which we introduce the concept n-gram language models, the probability of a word given a history ('prefix') only depends on the preceding  n−1  words.
